# First Iteration Tech Stack

## Context and Problem Statement

For the first iteration, we need a core tech stack to consistently work with.

## Considered Options

* Core Techs
  - The most basic technologies. HTML, CSS, JS
* Additional, specialized techs
  - Like react, npm, angular, etc.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Core Techs". Normally this would not be noted as a decision, but it is important to why we universally agreed on the basics. In order to achieve the minimalist approach that our client asked of us, we chose to use the most basic web technologies and later add ones on if we deem they are neccessary and worth the risk. For this project, our initial vision is very simple and possible in HTML, CSS, and JS so we will use these going forward.
