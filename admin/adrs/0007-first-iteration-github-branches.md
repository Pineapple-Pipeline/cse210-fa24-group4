# First Iteration Github Branches

## Context and Problem Statement

For the first iteration, we need github branches.

## Considered Options

* Dev Branches
  - Every dev gets their own branch to operate.
* Feature Branches
  - Every feature/modular component gets a branch. There would be a styling branch and a slider/homepage branch as well.
* Minimum
  - Just a playground branch so that we can build branches as needed.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Minimum". In order to make things are fast and minimum as possible, we chose the minimum option. Even though merge conflicts will occur, we plan to prevent this with modular coding and pair programmming. Once we have a better idea of our website (in later iterations), we will then make the github branches.
