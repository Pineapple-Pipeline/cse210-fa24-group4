# First Iterations Dev Tool(s)

## Context and Problem Statement

For the first iteration, we need at least 1 tool to provide.

## Considered Options

- Regex Tester
- JSON formatter
- JSON validator
- URL encoder/decoder

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "JSON formatter". For our first iteration we want to create the MVP, so we chose only 1 tool. We wanted to choose an easy tool to make and test, so with that criteria in mind we decided on the JSON formatter.
