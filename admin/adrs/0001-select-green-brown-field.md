# Selecting an Approach for Developing a Web-Based Dev Toolkit

## Context and Problem Statement

Our group needed to decide on the best approach for creating a web-based development toolkit

## Considered Options

* Greenfield Development
  - Building the toolkit from scratch, allowing for full control over architecture and features
* Brownfield Development
  - Starting with an existing repository, adding and modifying features to meet our toolkit requirements.
* Brownfield of Greenfield Problem
  - Building a toolkit, but based on an existing repository for a dev toolbox.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Greenfield Development", as it provided full control over the architecture, enabling us to implement features exactly as needed without restrictions from existing structures. This approach best matched our goal of building a toolkit tailored to our specifications, with a particular emphasis on supporting backend developers. While the brownfield approach presented its own advantages and disadvantages, after thorough brainstorming and research, we reached a consensus to start from scratch due to the broader scope of possibilities and greater creative freedom this option offered.
