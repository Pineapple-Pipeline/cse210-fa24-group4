 # Final Sprint New Dev-tool

## Context and Problem Statement

For this final sprint, we need to add a final tool to grow tool-kit usage, and provide more options for users. Since we have limited time, we cant add that many tools, so a common toolset that most developers use should be added. 

## Considered Options

- JWT Token Creator
- Session Cookie Creator
- UUID Generator

## Decision Outcome

We decided to create a singular tool and merge all 3 considered options into one tool. This is because each tool serves a similar purpose, and for a cleaner look to the developer tool kit, we can create a tool with all 3 features. Simplifying testing, e2e testing, styling, etc.
