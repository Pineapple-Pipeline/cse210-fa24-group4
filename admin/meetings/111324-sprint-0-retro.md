### Technique: Mad, Sad, Glad

## Mad
Add notes about things that frustrated you in the last iteration.

- **Time waste/unclear tasks/unclear meeting outcomes** *(0 votes)*  
    - The tasks that were decided on in sprint 0 weren't delegated and discussed in detail during the initial sprint meeting, so many team members were left confused on what to do for the duration of sprint 0.  
    - We are "prevented"/delayed from starting development on the technical level.  
    - Was unclear about the project structure, but it seems we should iterate through instead of trying to decide everything now.  
    - There wasn't a lot of structure, so I wasn't sure what we were doing or who was working on what.  
    - We couldn't cover all the discussions about task assignments and pipeline design in a single meeting, so we had to schedule additional sessions for further discussions and brainstorming.  
    - We steered off course a couple times, diving into unnecessary rabbit holes, which we can avoid next time.  
    - Felt like we wasted some time because we didn’t properly spend enough time talking about what we wanted to get done. Although we discussed our goals, some were too high-level and so those things didn’t end up getting done.

## Sad
Add notes about things that disappointed you in the last iteration.

- **Re-do/re-adopting iterative approach** *(0 votes)*  
    - I feel a bit disappointed that we couldn't adopt an iterative approach right from the beginning and had to make adjustments later. But not much sad as all of us are new to this thinking and processes being followed.  
    - A little sad that a lot of what we discussed during the meeting should be rehashed for sprint 1.  
- I am a bit sad that we only have around 3-4 weeks left for the design and development process. *(0 votes)*

## Glad
Add notes about things that excited you in the last iteration.

- **Team spirit/openness** *(0 votes)*  
    - The openness and creativity during our discussions, along with how we all came together to schedule meetings and engage in meaningful conversations. Meeting to teach and support one another, designing frameworks, finalizing tools, and making progress on the CI/CD pipeline—all while gradually setting up GitHub—felt like such a wholesome experience. I really, really liked and was super happy about how we decide and make changes as we proceed.  
    - I am glad we were very open in our discussions and gave honest criticism.

- **Iterative/directions to move forward/progress** *(0 votes)*  
    - Tested CI/CD and made it working and running. Although the pipeline is very tiny, we will improve it gradually.  
    - I’m glad that we seem to be in a good spot right now in terms of the way we’re iterating going forward, and the next couple of sprints will be good for us if we execute right now.  
    - I feel like in our last sprint meeting we really started to get on our feet and get moving in a good direction.  
    - Made a decision about the final vision of the project and how we will go about doing this.  
    - Happy that we were able to get decent progress in our weekly meetings. Makes it feel like we are on track.  
    - We were able to finalize and conclude on an initial design for our project.
