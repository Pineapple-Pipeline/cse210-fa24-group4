## Sad
Add notes about things that disappointed you in the last iteration.

- Our final work does differ from our initial project idea, but I believe we did the most that we could have with our allotted time. *(1 vote)*
- We don't have any releases yet. *(1 vote)*
- We still have a bit of code to push and we are cutting it kinda close. *(4 votes)*
- I feel like we have quite some work to do, so I hope we don't have to cram these next 2 days. *(1 vote)*
- Feels like we're lowkey crunching, but this could also just be a feature of the end-of-quarter design. *(3 votes)*
- We didn't merge to main frequently enough, so now it seems like we might run into merge hell during this sprint meeting. *(5 votes)*
- Lots of chores for the last sprint that we have to wrap up quickly. *(3 votes)*
- Sad that the project is ending sooooonnnnnn. *(1 vote)*
