# Retrium Retrospective, November 20, 2024
### Technique: Mad, Sad, Glad

## Mad
Add notes about things that frustrated you in the last iteration.

- Things that need to be done are changing constantly, so still a little confused on the tasks that we need to focus on for the duration of the sprint. *(1 vote)*
- I feel we are a sprint behind even though we had great progress. *(0 votes)*
- There's a slight lack of transparency in what each of us are working on and what we should be working on. *(4 votes)*
- We should clearly assign tasks to the people in the team. I feel like we could be delegating stuff better. *(2 votes)*
- Each of us were playing around with different properties, without knowing who's actually doing what, and that caused confusion in fetching changes. *(2 votes)*
- Not much direction on how to develop the web components, a lot of "up to us," "we can do it this way or that way." *(2 votes)*
- The web app was kind of made from a few people on a whim, so I'm feeling lost as to what process we took or how our web app works on the inside. *(7 votes)*
- I think the fact that we missed out on a group meeting to collectively code our first feature was a big mistake. I think this was a loss because we missed the opportunity to develop a cohesive coding style. I think the whole point of this first sprint was for all team members to get their feet wet with the product *together*, and we didn't accomplish that. *(3 votes)*

## Sad
Add notes about things that disappointed you in the last iteration.

- I felt like maybe we could follow the Figma design a bit more. *(4 votes)*
- Sad that I was unclear of the tasks that were upfront. *(2 votes)*
- It felt a bit like we just regressed into working on things individually without talking about them, which might work initially but I don't think it's necessarily a recipe for success. *(2 votes)*
- I finished my work fairly early in the week, so I had a lot of days where I wish I was doing something, but I was waiting for the next meeting. *(1 vote)*
- Took us this long to start coding and getting preliminary results for our web app. *(1 vote)*
- We were trying to schedule more meetings to work together, but none of them worked out. *(6 votes)*
- We should have been able to push something to main, but that's fixable. *(1 vote)*

## Glad
Add notes about things that excited you in the last iteration.

- Great progress in just 1 day. Good start to our first feature and the progress seen on GitHub, also the processes carried out with coding. *(0 votes)*
- We are making efforts to work together and work on tasks throughout the week. *(1 vote)*
- I am glad that we actually have something up and running, finished the goal we set. *(0 votes)*
- Finally started coding, getting good results for the initial "skeleton" app, adding components much simpler than expected. *(2 votes)*
- Really feels like we are making decent progress on the project, and the end result seems like it will be successful. *(1 vote)*
- Team dynamics is pretty good, and everyone seems to be inputting/contributing what they are good at. *(1 vote)*
- We have a good boilerplate ready and can get things done faster by working in parallel on multiple features. *(0 votes)*
- We have a working first iteration! *(0 votes)*
- A lot more clarity on what was assigned with the GitHub issues. *(2 votes)*
- I think we ended up getting some good work done and we are on good pace. I think we're headed in the right direction. *(0 votes)*
- I am glad we have a base structure with a feature working. *(0 votes)*
