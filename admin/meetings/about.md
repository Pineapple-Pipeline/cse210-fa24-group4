# Sprint Meetings Documentation

## 1. Sprint Launch

At the start of each sprint, we hold a **Sprint Launch** meeting to set clear expectations for the upcoming sprint. This document outlines the goals, priorities, and planning details for the sprint, ensuring everyone is aligned on the deliverables and timelines. It serves as the roadmap for team efforts and resource allocation throughout the sprint.

## 2. Sprint Review

The **Sprint Review** meeting occurs at the end of each sprint to reflect on what was accomplished, inspect the product increment, and gather valuable feedback. This document includes the updated backlog, a summary of completed tasks, key takeaways, and any demos of features developed. It provides a comprehensive view of the sprint’s progress and helps prioritize adjustments to the product backlog.

## 3. Sprint Retrospective

The **Sprint Retrospective** document collects feedback from each team member on the sprint’s internal processes, collaboration, and personal experiences. It captures what team members enjoyed, what challenges they faced, and any ideas for improvement. This feedback drives actionable steps to enhance the team’s workflow and morale in future sprints.
