# Sprint Review Meeting Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for each sprint review meeting conducted throughout the project. Each sprint review is documented as per the Agile methodology guidelines and includes the main accomplishments, participants, key takeaways, and media used during the meeting (notes, screen captures, or demo videos).

## Purpose

The purpose of the sprint review meeting is to demonstrate completed work to stakeholders, team members, and other interested parties. This meeting is **not for discussing the Agile process itself** but rather to show and tell completed tasks, deliverables, and progress. Process improvement discussions will take place during the **sprint retrospective** meeting.
